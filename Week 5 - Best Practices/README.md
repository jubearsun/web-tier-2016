# Best Practices

## Logistics
* New chumming is up! [tinyurl.com/wearethechumpians](http://tinyurl.com/wearethechumpians)
* Our tier name is "Web Babies" since no one else suggested anything and also because Peter and 
  John kept calling me "Web Mama" during retreat
* We need a logo (traditionally, it has been used at Banquet) -- if you have any Illustrator/Photoshop
  experience please help

## Lightning Talks!
* For the next 3 weeks, each of you will take turns giving a 2-min lesson to the rest of the tier about any topic you like!
* I'll go first this week, and nominate the 2 people for next week, etc.
* Topics that officers have done:
  * How to wavedash in Smash
  * Rap terminology
  * How to draw Simba
  * How to braid hair
* Be creative!

## Design Practices and Knowing Your Audience
* So far, we've been concentrating on technical skills (the how) but now it's time to start concentrating on why
* Let's start by talking about my meeting with IRC, what they wanted, and what I suggested for them and why
  * They wanted:
    * A separate page for every bullet point and sub bullet point on the Google Doc
    * Dropdown menu in the navbar pointing to every page
    * A calendar
    * A content management system for them to continually upload upcoming events onto the website
* Every week, I'm going to go over a website I made and why I did things a certain why. Suggestions, questions, welcome!

## Why Should I Care??
* Design and especially UI/UX is important
* A good web designer should not only be able to implement components but also have a good eye for design and consistently follow a good style guide!
* Web design != graphic design!  InnoD has a lot of graphic designers...Don't just blindly agree with them.  Trust your own eye for design, develop it.
* Web design isn't just about making a page pretty, it's also about file structure, good code style, and good interaction
* Example: why do people hate Cal Central?

## Fixing Merge Conflicts and Keeping Your Repo Up to Date
* Preferably, before you start working, `git pull canon master --rebase` to see if there
  are any changes that you don't have already.
* After you're done working, push your changes to your own repo and "compare" it
  to the main repo.  If it can be merged with no conflicts go ahead and make
  a pull request.
* If there are conflicts, you need to make sure your own changes are pushed
  or committed and then run `git pull canon master --rebase`.
  * You will encounter merge conflicts!  Don't worry they're not hard to fix.
  * Check which files have merge conflits with `git status`
  * Go to the files with merge conflicts and fix them :) you want to look for
    the parts that say `HEAD ==== <commit number>`
  * After you're done fixing, run `gatsby develop` to make sure nothing
    broke and then push your changes.
* Open a new pull request

## Lesson
* Let's go over what you guys did this week!  Come up and talk about what you did (and why)
* We're going to go over the code together afterwards :)

## Homework
* Continue working on the website!
* Prepare for lightning talk if you were nominated
* Start brainstorming for what you want your personal website to look like
